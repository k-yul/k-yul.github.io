# Development Instructions

This website uses https://gohugo.io/.

## Running the hugo server locally
In the terminal, run `hugo serve` to run the local server. It will automatically reload on changes to the content.

## Pushing (publishing) the changes to GitHub
In the terminal:
1. Stage the current changes `git add .` (this means add everything in the current directory)
2. Commit the current changes `git commit -m "some message describing your change"`
3. Push the changes to GitHub `git push`

After you push to GitHub, go to [Deployments](https://github.com/k-yul/k-yul.github.io/deployments) and monitor the status until it's a green checkmark.
