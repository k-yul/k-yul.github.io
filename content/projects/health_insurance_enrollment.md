## **Problem Statement**

**The Challenge**: The existing enrollment process was lengthy, confusing, and resulted in a high abandonment rate. Users struggled with understanding insurance plans, completing forms, and navigating the website and ended up using insurance brokers provided by the website to figure out their insurance needs.

**Target Audience**: Individuals aged 25-60 looking to enroll in health insurance, including first-time buyers and those switching plans.

* **Participants**: 10 individuals who had previously attempted to enroll in health insurance online.

**Key Findings**:



* **Complexity**: Users found the language and options too complex.
* **Navigation Issues**: The process was not intuitive, causing users to get lost or stuck.

## **Ideation**

**Brainstorming**:



* Utilized techniques such as mind mapping and sketching to generate ideas.

**Concept Development**:



* Focused on simplifying language, improving navigation.
* Developed concepts for a streamlined, step-by-step enrollment process with clear progress indicators.

## **Design**

**Wireframes and Prototypes**:



* Created low-fidelity wireframes to map out the new user flow.
* Developed high-fidelity prototypes using Figma, incorporating visual elements and interactions.

**Design Decisions**:



* **Simplified Language**: Used plain language and complex wording to make information more accessible.

## **Testing and Validation**

**Usability Testing**:



* Conducted usability testing with 10 participants using the high-fidelity prototype.

**Iterations**:



* Based on feedback, adjusted the placement of the progress bar, and enhanced mobile navigation.

## **Final Solution**

**Final Design**:



* Presented a clean, intuitive design with a step-by-step enrollment process.
* Key features included a simplified plan comparison tool, secure data entry forms, and real-time assistance.

**Implementation**:



* Conducted regular reviews and iterations to address any issues during development.
